## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

The user experience is how a user experiences your site. You should consider what the use wants to do on your site as well as what you want them to do and what you want them to feel 

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

You'll sell more stuff, build a loyal customer base, and leave users wanting to come back

3. Why is the User Experience important?

If users have a bad experience on your site, they won't come back and they might not follow-through with a purchase they intended to make when they arrived on your site.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Tower was a fun assignment! I got a pretty good start, and I'm really glad I went back and forth doing backend, then frontend. It helped me keep a consistent pace and not get burned out on any one part of the project
