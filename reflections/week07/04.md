## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

I have a marketing background, so I'm always thinking about the user experience and how to sell more stuff and create customer loyalty. I feel like I created a good customer experience on my Tower site.

2. What went well this week?

I'm really pleased with the styling I did on my site. It looked A LOT like the figma, more so than any other site I've done so far.

3. What would you do differently?

I would have spent a little more time and thought on my v-if/v-else rendering. I got it all done, but I done think I did it in the most efficient way or with any kind of planning or finesse.
