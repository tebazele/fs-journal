canva.com templates
w3schools css templates
squarespace or wordpress templates

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
First impressions are really important on the internet--good design shows professionalism and people are more likely to trust products being sold on sights that are designed well.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Bootstrap makes CSS sooooo much easier. I really like the rows and columns model--knowing there are 12 columns available in each row really helps me conceptualize how my sight will look and get stuff in the right places. Display: flex is really hard to get right, so it's great to have bootstrap to take care of it for me.
