## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
A psedo class is a css class that only applies when an event happens. I imagine :hover would be helpful and maybe :active which applied when a element is activated like a button click.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
Specificity tells us which rules will override other rules in css. If a rule is really important, you can use a more specific selector like class name or id rather than an html element selector, which is the least specific. 

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
It could be problematic if you set a rule that wasn't being applied because another rule with !important was overriding it.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

CSS is a lot of memorization. I'm having trouble figuring out which sets of properties go with each other and which you should never use in the same place, like how we should never use position: absolute or relative with display: flex. Also, positioning and aligning elements in general is really challenging. There are so many ways to do it, but I'm never sure which way is the best way until I run into a problem down the road.
