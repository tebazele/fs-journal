## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
Planning out a website so the entire team can get on board with the design and functionality. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, high-fidelity. Low-fidelity is good for the initial planning stage when you just want a rough idea of the layout. Mid-fidelity adds some detail but still leaves colors and much of the actual content out. High-fidelity is the blueprint to follow as you actually code up the site.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
Yes, it helps guide your design and functionality so you don't get lost as you code.
