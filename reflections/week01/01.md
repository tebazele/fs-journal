## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?
Git is used for version control. It's kind of like a souped up version of track changes, and helps developers keep track of when and what code they've written. 

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
It's easy to break stuff when adding new code, so it's a good idea to have test branches that don't commit directly to the main branch. If the tests work out, you can merge the branches. 

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub
GitHub is a remote repository that stores code on a server so multiple developers can commit code to a single project.
