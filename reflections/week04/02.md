## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

pending, resolved, rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
instead of passing callback functions, you can chain promises like this:
If first function resolves, then do second function
If second function resolves, then do third function...

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?
Then takes in a resolved promise and performs a task
Catch takes in the error if a promise fails and stops the program
