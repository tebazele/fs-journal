## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

It turns a function into a promise and won't run the rest of the code block until that promise resolves

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

You must use the keyword 'async' in front of your function declaration

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

You don't risk callback hell. You don't create a cascade of errors because the program stops running if a function doesn't resolve. You can use the debugger because the compiler sees the code as synchronous if you use async/await even though to you, it's asynchronous

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Working with apis is tough. I had a lot of trouble getting the data to come in how I wanted it, and I also had some trouble with my draw functions trying to draw to the page before the data had come in. Overall, my code is a mess. This may be one I need to redo more cleanly now that I know what I'm doing a bet better.
