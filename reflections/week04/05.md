# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I really like interacting with APIs. It feels like having all of this cool data right at my fingertips. I didn't have a chance to get my search bar working for the Gifted-gifs project and I'd like to figure that out because using an API to search sounds really useful. 

I'd also like to learn more about what makes Axios work. It's not really clear to me how we're using Axios to fetch information, and I feel like there are a lot of useful features I'm not taking advantage of. 

I'm looking forward to learning to write APIs. It's going to be awesome.
