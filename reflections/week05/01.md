## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?
To filter the results in a database by the value of a certain property (Like: see all Subarus, ?make='subaru')

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

?make='subaru'&model='legacy' you put a question mark at the beginning and an ampersand (&) between different parameters

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
When you want to filter the results of your database like if you wanted clients to be able to search for certain data
