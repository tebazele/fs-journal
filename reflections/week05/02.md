> **ðŸ“– [MongoDb Relationships](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk5/02-Relationships)**

## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?
one:one (1:1), one:many(1:N), many:many(N:M)

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`
When you embed, you can run into a problem of each data object getting way too large; it's usually better, especially in one:many and many:many relationships, to populate the data by pulling it in when a user views it rather than embedding it inside the data

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

We have to decide ahead of time how we want to be able to filter the data--for example, do we want to search books and get a list of authors or search by author and get a list of each author's books? Or do we want to be able to do both?
