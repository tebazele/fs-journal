## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
You know the basic functionality you're trying to write and the steps to need to take to get it done. Looking at the entire problem can be overwhelming, and planning helps to break it into smaller, more manageable chunks. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
Google-woo! Also, the TAs have answered a lot of my questions, and I've looked back at the lecture project builds--those have been really helpful. Other students can also help if they've encountered a similar problem, and just talking out loud can help me work through something that's stumping me. 

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
I still think some of the best advice both from the article and our instructors is to make small changes and test stuff as you go. Write something, test it, write something, test. It's helped me work through problems more seemlessly.
