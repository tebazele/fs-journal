## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

The part of the code a variable is available in

2. What is Hoisting ?

pushing variables and function definitions to the top of the code so you can use them above where you declare them

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

var doesn't seem to be used much anymore--the problem is that you can accidentally re-declare it, which makes you think you're using a new variable and can cause bugs in your code.
let is for variables you want to re-assign
const is for variables you don't want to re-assign
