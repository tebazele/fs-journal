## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

To restrict user access to certain functionality 

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

When using closures, it's easier to make changes that break the functionality, it's easier for your data types to be 'leaked' to your users, hackers have access to too much of your code, and all of your documentation exists where a user can see it. 

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

prepend the function name with an underscore. This doesn't actually make the function private, but it lets a non-malicious person viewing your code know that the function shouldn't be changed.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Mick said that the ObjectControllers modules don't speak to each other, but the ObjectServices modules can if necessary. I didn't end up needing to import from one service to the other (I just used an event listener that listened for changes to a variable in my appState), but I can see how I'd do that if I wanted to. I might have exported my snackServices instance to my MoneyServices module in order to have the "check if there's enough money" function available each time money is added.
