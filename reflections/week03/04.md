> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
It helps separate responsibilities of certain modules while linking them through another module they both have access to. The way we've been using the observer keeps the Controller and Services separate in the MVC while linking them through the variables in the appState. The observer helps keep different modules in sync.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

subscribe, unsubscribe, broadcast

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

The proxy object links the functionality to the view while protecting data that shouldn't be changed from user manipulation. And the observer links the controller and service modules through the appState without them needing to have access to each others' code. It's solving a problem of access while keeping important stuff private. It's cool. I feel like the observer pattern is really powerful, and I'd like to learn more about Proxy objects and how to use them.

This was a fun assignment. Today I learned about live share and it made coding with my partner soooo much faster and easier. I really enjoyed this project.
