## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
It allows the developer to show a potential employer his/her skills.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
Quality work and showing a variety of skills, not necessarily the particular projects.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
I'm proud of my Tower application because I think I really did a good job writing both the front and backend. My code is very clean and I really understood everything I was writing, and I think it looks really schnazzy.
