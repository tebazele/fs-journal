# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I really like my group. We all work so well together, and it's so nice to be able to split the work up with other people who really know what they're doing. It feels like we've already accomplished so much more than I could do on my own. I think I'm really going to enjoy working on a team as a developer in my future job.
