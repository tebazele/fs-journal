## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
Unit testing, component testing, and end-to-end testing. Unit testing tests the smallest possible bit of functionality at a time, making sure the details of the app are solid. Component testing allows you to test components before they get inserted into a page, which may have problems of its own. End to end testing helps you see what problems a user might encounter and fix them before going to production.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
I think each has its usefulness, but end-to-end is the most important to finish with because it represents what the user will experience when using the app. 

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
Maybe component testing because how much more difficult is it really to pop your component onto a page and test there, but I also think they all these types of have their place and their usefulness.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

We need some serious styling on this site. It's pretty boring right now. I wonder if we could include sounds--like audio feedback for creating a meal plan or something...
