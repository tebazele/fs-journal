## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?
It's still important to know what everyone is working on so no two people are working on the same thing independently. It can save time and keep the team moving forward.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
You don't necessarily have to do things by the book if that doesn't make sense for your team. On a small team, people may have to wear multiple hats/take on additional roles in order to optimize communication and effort.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
Fast - Cheap - Good: A product can't be all three at the same time. Sometimes, you just need something quickly that doesn't have to be good. Sometimes you need something good fast, so it'll cost a lot. And other times, you need something good and cheap but it can take a while.
