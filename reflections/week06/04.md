## Questions

1. What is a nested route?
These are route paths that look like urls to the browser even though Vue is a SPA language

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)
You might want to go to any number of pages that aren't the home page, which means you're loading a different page into the router-view each time

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
Yes, you might want to pass an id of a profile into the route to navigate to that person's profile page
