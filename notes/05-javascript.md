<!-- SECTION variables -->
<h1>Variables</h1>

let and var are hoisted within their scope

var can be redefined (var greeting="hello"; var greeting="hi";)

let variables can be re-assigned but not redefined

var is initialized as undefined; let is not (if you use let variable before assignment, you get a reference error)

const and let variables are block scoped

const cannot be redefined or reassigned

const must be initialized at declaration

const object values can be changed
