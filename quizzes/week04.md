# UnderStanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

**1.** What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
asynchronous means not happening at the same time; asynchronous code is code that runs once a certain condition has been met or another function has completed its run. Synchronous code is code that's executed in order regardless of the state of other functions in the code
```
**2.** What is an event listener?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Code that watches an element or variable and triggers a function when it sees something happen to that element or variable
```
**3.** What does the `O` represent in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Open-close principle: an application should be open for extension (more code, more features, more functionality) but but closed to (encapsulated) modification (data and base functions are protected from changes that might break stuff)
```
**4.** What is a callback / higher order function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A callback or higher order function is a function that calls another function
```
**5.** What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A promise is a function that runs after another function completes or a certain condition is met. It returns either 'pending,' 'resolved,' or 'rejected.' You '.catch' an error from a promise
```

```
**7.** What does the `API` acronym stand for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

Application Programming Interface
```
**8.** In the `MVC` design pattern, who is responsible for making calls to `APIs`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Service
```
**9.** What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
To protect data and private functionality from manipulation by the user in the view
```
**10.** What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
